This repository contains code from the masterclass conducted during my internship, where I learned to plot graphs and perform basic data manipulation and visualization techniques in R. It also includes the code for my final project assignment. Here are the key points of the final assignment:

# Health Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a health dataset provided with information on individuals' ID, weight, blood pressure (BP), locality, smoking status, and tumor presence. The primary tasks involved working with this dataset in R to perform various data manipulation and visualization tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each individual
- **Weight**: Weight of the individual
- **BP (Blood Pressure)**: Blood pressure reading of the individual
- **Locality**: Locality where the individual resides
- **Smoking**: Smoking status (Yes/No)
- **Tumor**: Presence of a tumor (Yes/No)

## Tasks

### 1. Create a DataFrame in R
The first task was to write a command to create a DataFrame in R using the provided dataset.

### 2. Plot a Graph Between Weight and Blood Pressure
The second task was to write a command to plot a graph visualizing the relationship between weight and blood pressure.

### 3. Create a Stacked Chart Between Smoking and Tumor
The third task was to write a command to create a stacked chart showing the relationship between smoking status and the presence of a tumor.

These tasks are designed to demonstrate basic data manipulation and visualization techniques using R.

Here are the images from my assignment.
